# GAME POINTS

It is a very simple game. Your goal is to collect as many score points as possible, you do this by clicking on the items that will appear on the board.
You need to be fast though, because the items will disappear after a short while.
Before you start make sure you are familiar with the scores of the items which are visible in the menu on the right side.
Then hit START GAME button when ready.

The game is available [here](https://game-points-tn.herokuapp.com/), but you can run it localy if you want.

## TODO:
- add a timer, i think that having 30 seconds to collect is enough,
- add a scoreboard, we are collecting the items, but is that more or less than the previous one?
- add welcome screen / how to play info, can be in the empty board space,
